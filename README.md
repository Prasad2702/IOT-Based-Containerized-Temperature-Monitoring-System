# IOT-Based-Containerized-Temperature-Monitoring-System
This project presents a Smart Containerized Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System that continuously tracks environmental conditions within a container. It uses a Raspberry Pi as a gateway and a DHT sensor for real-time data acquisition, with a Python Flask backend. Data is stored locally in a MySQL database for real-time and historical access via a web interface developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.The system also integrates AWS services, including AWS SES for email alerts when thresholds are breached and AWS S3 for hourly data storage, ensuring redundancy and remote accessibility. The web interface is globally accessible through PythonAnywhere, making the system versatile for wide-scale deployment. This system provides real-time monitoring, robust data management, and effective alerting mechanisms, ideal for maintaining optimal conditions in sensitive environments.
